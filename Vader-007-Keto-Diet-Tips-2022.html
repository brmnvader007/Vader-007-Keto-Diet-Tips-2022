<p>Here are 15 of the best keto diet tips and tricks to get started and stick to it:</p>

<p>1. Start with a Fat Bomb</p>

<p>Many people find that transitioning into a ketogenic diet is made much easier when they start out with a tasty fat bomb snack. These snacks are packed full of fats like butter, coconut oil, MCT oil or even bulletproof coffee.</p>

<p>Keto dieters usually eat these bombs as a between meal snack or even as a dessert during dinner. This is because they taste delicious and provide them with the quick energy required to keep up with the keto diet plan.</p>

<p>2. Keep a Low Carb Snack With You at All Times</p>

<p>If you're constantly hungry, your body is probably using up all its glucose at once. When this happens, your body can begin to break down fat for energy as well as protein, which can lead to muscle loss over time. Having an emergency snack on hand will prevent this from happening and ensure that you don't get too hungry between meals.</p>

<p>3. Drink Plenty of Water and Other Keto Friendly Beverages</p>

<p>When you're starting out with the low-carb lifestyle, you need to make sure that you're drinking plenty of water throughout the day in order to give your body the hyd</p>

<p>The ketogenic diet is a low carb, high fat diet that has been proven to promote rapid weight loss and improved health.</p>



<p>It requires you to cut out a large portion of carbohydrates in your diet and replace it with healthy fats. When you restrict carbs from your diet, you re-adjust your body to run off dietary and body fat as its main source of energy.</p>



<p>Adopting a low carb, high fat diet has been shown to provide several health benefits like reduced inflammation, improved brain function and rapid weight loss[*][*][*].</p>



<p>But just the thought of cutting carbohydrates out of your diet can discourage many people from following this way of eating. Luckily, there are several tricks you can implement immediately to help you start the low carb, high fat diet with minimal effort.</p>

<p>Here are the 15 best keto diet tips and tricks to get started and stay on track losing weight on this way of eating:</p>

<p>1. Plan your meals</p>

<p>Keto is not a free for all. It's a very specific way of eating. If you aren't organized, you'll end up missing out on important nutrients and won't be able to stay in ketosis.</p>

<p>5. Drink Water</p>

<p>Drinking water will help you stay hydrated and make you feel full without having to eat more food, which can stop ketosis. It also helps to flush out toxins from your body as well as reduce hunger pangs. You should aim to drink at least half your bodyweight in ounces every day (that's about 2 liters).</p>

<p>2. Don't Give Up</p>

<p>This diet is challenging, especially at first when you're feeling tired, hungry and have cravings for carbs. But that's why it works so well – the only way to succeed is to stick with it!</p>

<p>6. Stay Active</p>

<p>Exercising while following a low carb diet has many added benefits like boosting fat burning, reducing joint pain and improving mental health[*][*]. Aim for 30 minutes of exercise every day but don't forget to rest and listen to your</p>

<p>There are multiple dieting methods that promise you fast weight loss and better health.</p>

<p>Intermittent fasting, low carb dieting and ketogenic dieting are some of the most popular ones.</p>

<p>Are they equally effective? What are their pros and cons?</p>

<p>For example, the ketogenic diet is high in fat and low in carbs, which is not only good for weight loss but also beneficial for specific health conditions[*][*]. But its strict rules can be discouraging for many people to follow.</p>

<p>Tricks and Tips to Make Keto Diet Easier</p>

<p>There are a few tricks you can implement immediately to make your keto diet easier. Here's how:</p>

<p>Here are 15 keto diet tips and tricks to help you get started and stick to it.</p>



<p>1. Eat when you're hungry. If you're having a hard time sticking to the keto diet, try eating only when you're hungry. Hunger is the key signal that tells your body it needs food, so listen to it. This is the easiest way to start the keto diet.</p>



<p>2. Eat more fat and protein. Once you've got the hang of eating only when hungry, it's time to up your fat and protein intake, since this will turn into energy for your body. You should be getting about 70% of your calories from fat, 20% from protein and 10% from carbohydrates. The best sources of dietary fat include olive oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter and ghee (Indian clarified butter). Good sources of protein include meat, fish, eggs and legumes like beans and lentils.*</p>
